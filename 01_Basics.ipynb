    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Financial data used to be very expensive, typically costing USD 10-20,000 for an annual subscription, making it impossible for ordinary people to obtain the data. It was limited to banks and hedge funds which usually keep their research private, and academia which has proven unable to turn finance theory into a real science.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the advent of XBRL data, US companies are now required to publish their financial data in digital form, which means it can be collected automatically into a database. Unfortunately, there are several challenges in collecting and standardizing the data, so companies have sprung up to provide that service at a very low cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the new data providers often have a complicated API, which is very far from how people will actually use the data. Every user has to build the infrastructure for downloading the data, saving it to disk, and loading it into a format that can actually be used in research and production.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [SimFin Python API](https://www.github.com/SimFin/simfin) solves all these problems with a simple and elegant API, making it very easy to download and use the financial data. Furthermore, the basic SimFin datasets are all free, so you can easily share your research in Python Notebooks that automatically download the financial data, when people run the Notebook on their own computer or in the cloud using e.g. Google Colab.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a game-changer in how financial research can be created and shared. Hopefully it can break the monopoly of academia and the financial industry, so everyone with a good idea can now do research in finance.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial shows the basics of using the SimFin Python API. The tutorial has two main parts. The first part is about the SimFin Python API, and the second part is a more general introduction to Pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a convenient [web-page](https://simfin.com/data/bulk) with a list of the available datasets and their content, along with the Python code for loading them. You may want to bookmark that web-page in your internet browser, as it will save you a lot of time when working with the SimFin API."

    "### Virtual Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "It is best to use a virtual environment when installing Python packages, so they are not installed inside your main Python installation. That makes it easy to remove the packages if something goes wrong. Please see the README file for this tutorial, for a detailed explanation on how to create virtual environments."

All the required Python packages should already be installed on Google Colab, except for SimFin which you can install by executing the above command. A virtual / temporary environment is automatically created on Google Colab each time you login, so you can install SimFin directly."

A value of `refresh_days=0` forces download of the dataset, regardless of when you downloaded it last and how old the data-file is on your disk.

    "- **Report Date** is the date of the financial report, but this is not the date when the report was published. For example, an annual report with a Report Date of 2018-12-31 means that the period of the financial report is the 12 months ending on that date.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Publish Date** is the date the financial report was made available to the public. For example, a financial report for the 12 months ending on 2018-12-31 may first have been made public a few months later e.g. on 2019-02-05.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Restated Date** is the last date that the financial report was restated by the company. It is possible that a financial report has been restated multiple times, in which case this is the most recent date that it was restated. If the report was never restated, then this date will be the same as the Publish Date.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also note the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The standard SimFin datasets always use the newest available data from the latest restatement. So even though the Publish Date is e.g. 2019-02-05, if the Restated Date is e.g. 2020-03-17 then the financial data is actually from this latter date. So the SimFin datasets are not so-called \"point-in-time\" data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For US companies, the Publish Date is for the Form 10-K or 10-Q which are the official annual and quarterly reports. Sometimes companies publish preliminary earnings reports in a Form 8-K, but those are not considered for the Publish Date.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You should typically not index the DataFrame on the Restated Date because multiple rows can then have the same index-value, if the company has restated multiple financial reports on the same date.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the kind of analysis you want to do, an alternative to using the Publish Date as the DataFrame index, is to add an offset to all the Report Dates in a DataFrame using a small helper-function. For example, we can add 90 days (about 3 months) to all the Report Dates, and use that as an estimate for when the data was available publicly:"

This is useful for getting more data-points during a year. For example, we can use the TTM Income Statements when calculating P/E or P/Sales ratios (see further below)."

    "There are two main reasons for using a single `df.loc[]` operation instead of chained lookup. The first reason is due to performance, as it is supposed to be faster to use a single lookup operation, instead of two chained lookup operations. But as we can see from these `timeit` experiments, the performance difference may be tiny, and in some cases it is actually slightly faster when using chained lookup operations."

Because the DataFrame only has a single index which is a date, Pandas can do more advanced pattern-matching and select all dates between these end-points, even though '2010-01' is only partially defined. Also note that the end-points don't need to exist in the DataFrame, as would be required when using `df.loc[]` for the slicing."
