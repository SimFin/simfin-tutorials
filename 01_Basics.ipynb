    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Financial data used to be very expensive, typically costing USD 10-20,000 for an annual subscription, making it impossible for ordinary people to obtain the data. It was limited to banks and hedge funds which usually keep their research private, and academia which has proven unable to turn finance theory into a real science.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the advent of XBRL data, US companies are now required to publish their financial data in digital form, which means it can be collected automatically into a database. Unfortunately, there are several challenges in collecting and standardizing the data, so companies have sprung up to provide that service at a very low cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the new data providers often have a complicated API, which is very far from how people will actually use the data. Every user has to build the infrastructure for downloading the data, saving it to disk, and loading it into a format that can actually be used in research and production.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [SimFin Python API](https://www.github.com/SimFin/simfin) solves all these problems with a simple and elegant API, making it very easy to download and use the financial data. Furthermore, the basic SimFin datasets are all free, so you can easily share your research in Python Notebooks that automatically download the financial data, when people run the Notebook on their own computer or in the cloud using e.g. Google Colab.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a game-changer in how financial research can be created and shared. Hopefully it can break the monopoly of academia and the financial industry, so everyone with a good idea can now do research in finance.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial shows the basics of using the SimFin Python API. The tutorial has two main parts. The first part is about the SimFin Python API, and the second part is a more general introduction to Pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a convenient [web-page](https://simfin.com/data/bulk) with a list of the available datasets and their content, along with the Python code for loading them. You may want to bookmark that web-page in your internet browser, as it will save you a lot of time when working with the SimFin API."

    "### Virtual Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "It is best to use a virtual environment when installing Python packages, so they are not installed inside your main Python installation. That makes it easy to remove the packages if something goes wrong. Please see the README file for this tutorial, for a detailed explanation on how to create virtual environments."

All the required Python packages should already be installed on Google Colab, except for SimFin which you can install by executing the above command. A virtual / temporary environment is automatically created on Google Colab each time you login, so you can install SimFin directly."

    "- The `market` for the dataset e.g. 'us' for USA or 'de' for Germany (Deutschland).\n",

A value of `refresh_days=0` forces download of the dataset, regardless of when you downloaded it last and how old the data-file is on your disk.

The standard SimFin datasets always use the newest available data, which means there can be several years between the period of the financial report (Report Date) and the Publish Date. (In the future, SimFin may also provide datasets that contain all the original and restated reports.)\n",

This is useful for getting more data-points during a year. For example, we can use the TTM Income Statements when calculating P/E or P/Sales ratios (see further below)."

The first reason is due to performance, as it is supposed to be faster to use a single lookup operation, instead of two chained lookup operations. But as we can see from these `timeit` experiments, the performance difference may be tiny, and in some cases it is actually slightly faster when using chained lookup operations."

Because the DataFrame only has a single index which is a date, Pandas can do more advanced pattern-matching and select all dates between these end-points, even though '2010-01' is only partially defined. Also note that the end-points don't need to exist in the DataFrame, as would be required when using `df.loc[]` for the slicing."
